# Applied Econometric

**This repo is still in preparation! I'm constantly adding, deleting, updating files and datasets. Anything in this repo is not final, all mistakes are mine.**

This repo contains some of the most basic applications of econometrics theories, including return calculations, probability/stats and risk management, time-series analysis, portfolio theories. 

Below is a short table of content: (you can find the corresponding folders and codes by name)
1. A quick review of R and rmarkdown
2. Return Calculation and Plotting
3. More on probability theory and Monte Carlo Simulation
4. VaR (value-at-risk) and ES (expected shortfall)
5. Basic time-series analysis in R
6. More on time-series analysis in R
