*To set up the working directory, maybe you also want to enter the same folder name, e.g., `setwd("Desktop")`, in the **Console** window.*


# Advantages of R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. In particular, you can check this R Markdown cheatsheet <https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf> or the Markdown cheatsheet <https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet>.

<u>The following are some nice features.</u>

## R code chunks

Click on "Insert" and then "R" buttons to embed a R code chunk within the document. Then, click the **Knit** button to create a document that *includes both content as well as the output*.

```{r basic}
# basic is the name of this code chunk
x <- 2 - 3 * 4 / 5 ** 2
x
```

As we can see, the result is `r x ** 2` (known as R inline code). 

## Math inside R Markdown

It is convenient to type mathematical expressions. **(Note: Do not leave a space between the $ and your mathematical notation.)**

Example 1 (inline math): `$\sum_{n=1}^{100} n^2$` is rendered as $\sum\limits_{n=1}^{100} n^2$.

Example 2 (equation block)):

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2
$$
or
$$
\begin{aligned}
R_t & = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} \\
  & = \frac{\$18 - \$15}{\$15}\\
  &= 0.2 \text{ or } 20\%.
\end{aligned}
$$
See [this page](https://www.calvin.edu/~rpruim/courses/s341/S17/from-class/MathinRmd.html) for more details on LaTex code.

## Block-level elements

Section headers can be written after a number of pound signs, e.g.,

> # First-level header
> ## Second-level header
> ### Third-level header

## Order and unordered list items

Ordered list items start with numbers, and Unordered list items start with *, -, or +, and you can nest one list within another list by indenting the sub-list, e.g.,

> 1. the first item
> 2. the second item
> 3. the third item
>     - one unordered item
>     - one unordered item

See [this page](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/markdown-syntax.html#math-expressions) for more details.

## Italics and bold

+ `*` or `_` can be used to note *emphasis*
+ `**` or `__` can be used to __bold text__
+ They can be used __*together*__ (text in bold italics)

**In the future, you are required to write homework answers using R Markdown!**


# Short introduction to programming with R

We aim to go over some of the commands in this [cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/r-cheat-sheet-3.pdf).

## Download dataset

## load dataset

To import the excel file with .csv extension, we use the function read.csv. It reads from an Excel spreadsheet and returns a data frame. 

```{r df}
getwd()

# load the dataset in the working directory
df <- read.csv("MSFT.csv")

# set output options to show only 5 significant digits (optional)
options(digits = 5) 

class(df) # type of object
head(df) # first 6 rows
summary(df) # summary statistics
```

For excel file with .xls or .xlsx extension, we can use the function read_excel from the readxl package.

```{r}
# install.packages('readxl')
# load the 'readxl' package
library(readxl)

df <- read_excel('MSFT.xlsx')
head(df)
```

## Variables

```{r}
open <- df$Open
close <- df$Close
class(open)
head(open)
open[1:5] # Square brackets! 1 and 5 are indices
```

## for loop

```{r loop}
length(close)
for (t in 1:length(close)){
  df$diff[t] <- close[t] - open[t]
}

# or you can do
df$diff_new = close - open 
head(df)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r df_1, echo = FALSE}
plot(df$Date, 
     df$Open, 
     main = "Opening MSFT Prices",
     ylab = "Prices", 
     xlab = 'Date')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

(We can use ggplot2 to create better figures.)
